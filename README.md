# Introduction:
This project contains a collection of interactive visualizations for common graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms. 
Using Matplotlib, each script animates how the algorithm explores a grid, manages its internal data structures (Stacks, Queues, or Priority Queues),
and eventually reconstructs the optimal path.

# Dependencies:
To run these scripts, you need Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:
Matplotlib: For rendering the grid, colors, and animations.
NumPy: Used for numerical operations and grid manipulation.
install: pip install matplotlib
